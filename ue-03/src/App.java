     * I am personally no fan of this approach for multiple reasons:
     * - No fixed naming conventions for static protected variables
     *   They remind me of constant variables which should not be changed,
     *   however as far I have found this naming convention also goes for
     *   protected static vars.
     * 
     * - Using static variables just so I have access to them everywhere
     *   is not a nice approach, however I like  splitting up my code
     *   for better maintainability and with no class context this was
     *   the best approach I could think of.
     *   Return values of function would not have worked since I would have to
     *   return multiple values of my function, maybe Java supports this
     *   behavior but I don't know how and think this would go out of scope
     *   of the exercise.
